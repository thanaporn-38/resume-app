      <p>
      I am a senior Computer Science student at Naresuan University
      with skills in Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.
      I have experience in system analysis, software development, AI,
      and Azure, along with studies in Data Science. I led a project to
      modernize a board game into an interactive online platform.
